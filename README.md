## Development Reflection

### What Went Well
- Implementing CRUD operations was straightforward with React hooks
- The unified NoteComposer component for both create/edit modes worked elegantly
- Custom hooks (useNote, useFilteredNote) kept the code organized
- Tailwind CSS made responsive styling quick

### Challenges
- Managing filter state persistence when adding new notes required rethinking the data flow
- Coordinating search and filter state across components needed careful prop drilling
- Ensuring pinned notes stayed at the top while maintaining sort order

### Next Refactoring Priorities
1. Fix the filter persistence bug in useFilteredNote
2. Add React Testing Library tests for core functionality
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add debounce to search input for better performance
5. Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and focus management
